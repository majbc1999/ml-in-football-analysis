\section{Introduction}

This paper was written as an attempt to investigate the area of sports predicting.
Sports predicting is mainly used by bookmakers, in order to offer bets, that do 
not produce loss of profit. But on the other hand, odds should be as fair (high) as possible
in order to attract more and more gamblers. So predicting the result of a game as accurately
as possible is the essence of every bookmaker. This article (and experiment) will focus on 
predicting the result of football matches in term of home win (home team scores more goals),
draw (same goal amount for each team) and away win (away team scores more goals).

First chapter of this paper will contain information of related work. This includes a short recap
of new discoveries regarding Bayesian networks and
other machine learning techniques, that are being used for predicting sports results and also a summary of 
new discoveries in regard to betting on sports events.

Second chapter will talk about the experiment we conducted. We will describe how we acquired 
data for our experiment, how the data was processed in order to be suitable for some machine 
learning techniques. We will also describe, which machine learning techniques we used in our experiment.
Then, we will talk about output data, that the algorithms will return and how to compare
results with each other. We will also discuss, which metrics for evaluation will be useful,
and which metrics actually matter the most for our experiment (and in general, which metrics
matter the most to bookmakers).

Third chapter of this paper will focus on results of our experiment. There, we will compare 
different algorithms, that were applied to our data and evaluate each one, in regard to metrics.
We will also discuss, how data size affects quality of our prediction. We will compare 
returned probabilities for different match results, to probabilities, that were given by
bookmaker. Finally, we will decide, whether our models are able to beat the odds by chosen bookmaker
or not.

Fourth and final chapter is called \emph{Conclusion}, where all important results will be 
discussed. We will also evaluate our whole experiment and talk about the possible further work 
there.

\section{Related Work}

Unsurprisingly, a lot of work has already been done in this area, as sports betting is a field,
where enormous amount of money is being made every day. Firstly, we will talk about Bayesian networks.

\subsection{Bayesian networks}

Bayesian networks are a type of probabilistic graphical model, that uses Bayesian 
inference for probability computations. Bayesian networks aim to model conditional 
dependence, and therefore causation, by representing conditional dependence by 
edges in a directed graph. Edges in graph correspond to conditional dependency and 
each node corresponds to a different random variable.

Our goal in this article will be to predict the correct type of result for a game, similar 
to the work done in article \cite{Razali_2017}. The author of that article used Bayesian
nets on all available statistics of games and achieved 75 percent accuracy. Although, it must 
be stated, that author used match statistics to predict result of the same match, which is not
particularly useful, because match statistics cannot be known before the game. In this article,
we will try to predict match result, only using data, that was already known \textbf{before}
the game started.

\subsection{Sports predicting}

Betting in sports started with horse racing in the early 1900s. Although betting was 
not always legal (depends on a specific country), that did not stop people to still
gamble on sports events. That's why correctly predicting probabilities of sports 
results were very important to bookmakers, ever since betting existed. Therefore
machine learning was a very interesting option for bookmakers to consider, as it 
was very objective and it used math and algorithms to predict results. With machine learning, bookmakers 
could also offer odds for games and competitions, that they were not so very familiar 
with.

First attempt to predict sports results with the help of machine learning was in
1977, where the author of article \cite{Stefani_1977} used a technique called \textit{least squared model}.
That model was used to predict strength of opposing teams with goal scoring distribution matrix.
Observed accuracy in that model was 72 percent for college football games, 68 percent for pro 
football games and 69 percent for college basketball games.

First recorded usage of Bayesian networks in attempt to predict football results was used in
year 2001, in article \cite{Rue_2001}. The authors took an applied statistician's approach to the problem, 
suggesting a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model to estimate the time-dependent 
skills of all teams in a league and to predict the next week-end's football matches.

Paper \cite{Joseph_2006} from 2006 compared expert constructed Bayesian networks' ability to 
predict football 
results with other machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree learner, MC4, Naive Bayes learner,
Data driven Bayesian nets (which we will be using in our experiment), $K$-nearest neighbours, etc. 
The results from there confirmed, that Bayesian nets have great potential for predicting sport
results, as the authors had predictive accuracy of almost 60 percent, compared to second best
algorithm, $K$-nearest neighbours, which had an accuracy of little above 50 percent. Data, that the authors 
used for prediction, were home advantage, opposition team quality and characteristics of team's best players.


In 2010, article \cite{Baio_2010} proposed Bayesian hierarchical model, to predict final result 
of the game.

\subsection{Betting in sports}

This sub chapter contains some information about betting and explains some of the technical terms, such as 
\textit{odds}. So if you are already familiar with betting, you are free to skip this part.

Betting on sports events is almost as old as sport events itself. Bookmakers usually offer odds on 
some event. Odds tell bettors how much money they will receive, if that event happens. Odds are therefore 
directly related to the probability of the event. If probability of an event is higher, the odds for it will
naturally be lower. Bookmakers also never offer totally fair odds. That way they assure themselves of a 
guaranteed profit, over a long time period.
For example, if a probability of an event is expected to be 50 percent, bookmakers will never offer to pay 
out double of what you bet, but a little less. For example, bookmaker \texit{bet365} (betting website from
which we will get our
data), offers to pay out 1.90 times your bet, for an event with probability of 50\%. 

Profiting from a betting market has also been extensively studied in the past. People sometimes compare odds from
different bookmakers, to find an arbitrage strategy. Profiting from an inefficient association football gambling
market has been studied in article \cite{Constantinou_2013} from 2013. In the paper, a Bayesian network is used
for forecasting match outcomes. Profitability, risk and uncertainty are evaluated in there. Although the author
presented a model, that is less complex then some previous ones, it returned better results. The model considers
both objective and subjective information for prediction.  However, it is important to point out, that the 
model, which generated profit, was critically dependent on the knowledge of the expert. Performance, generated 
only on past data, would not be as successful.

\section{Experiment description}

This chapter contains all the description of how the experiment was carried out.

\subsection{Tools used}

The data tables were acquired from the web page \emph{Football-Data.co.uk}, and were in the \texttt{.csv} form.
Then data was processed with a programming language \texttt{Python} and its library \texttt{pandas}. After 
that, we
applied different machine learning algorithms from \texttt{scikit-learn} package \cite{scikit-learn}. Bayesian networks were applied 
from the \texttt{pomegranate} library. Returned data was further processed 
with \texttt{pandas}. All the plots, displayed in 
this paper, were made with \texttt{matplotlib} library.

\subsection{Data}

Data describes every
football game of Spanish first division, La Liga (Primera División), from season 2013/2014 to 2021/2022. Since each season has 
380 games, total data set contained 3420 games. Every game was a row in the data frame and for each game, the columns represented 
the stats from the game. Some data was unnecessary for match result prediction, for example number of yellow cards from each game.
Important statistics, that was later used in model construction, was:
\begin{itemize}
    \item date of the game,
    \item home team name,
    \item away team name,
    \item home team number of scored goals,
    \item away team number of scored goals,
    \item result of the game (home win, away win or draw),
    \item home team number of shots,
    \item away team number of shots,
    \item home team number of corners,
    \item away team number of corners,
    \item bet365 odds for home win,
    \item bet365 odds for away win,
    \item bet365 odds for draw
\end{itemize}

It is important to point out, that data in this form cannot be used to predict results. The data was being acquired during the game,
but our prediction must be made before the game. It would of course be pointless to predict the result of the game, if we had 
already known, how much goals any of the teams had scored. So we needed to find a way, to predict a result of the game, 
without using that game's data. We did that by using data from games, that happened before the match, that we are predicting. 
That procedure is described in \emph{Data processing} subsection.

Odds data will be used to compare our algorithm's predicted probabilities with bookmaker's predicted probabilities.

\subsection{Data processing}

In order to transform the data, so we could construct models for predicting, we firstly dropped those columns, which were not needed
for predicting. Then each game was assigned a unique index. An iteration through data frame was performed, in order to obtain each team's
order of playing. A new dictionary was defined, where team names were keys and values were ordered lists of game indexes. 

Then another iteration was made through the original data frame. For each played game, we looked for $k$ (we tried different $k$-s
and also compared results) previous games for home and away team. The general idea behind this was, that we determined strength of
a team, based on its previous results. For example, points, that the team received in previous $k$ games were summed, etc.

In the end, we got a new data frame, with the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{index}: unique index, assigned to each game;
    \item \textit{result}: final result of the game (home win, draw or away win),
    \item \textit{odds\_home}, \textit{odds\_draw} and \textit{odds\_away}: bet365 odds for each possible outcome of the game;
    \item \textit{points\_home} and \textit{points\_away}: points, that home and away team scored in the last $k$ games. Note,
    that a team gets 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss;
    \item \textit{goals\_scored\_home} and \textit{goals\_scored\_away}: a sum of goals, scored in past $k$ games for home and away
    team;
    \item \textit{goals\_conceded\_home} and \textit{goals\_conceded\_away}: a sum of goals, conceded in past $k$ games for home 
    and away team;
    \item \textit{shots\_given\_home} and \textit{shots\_given\_away}: a sum of shots given, in past $k$ games for home 
    and away team,
    \item \textit{shots\_conceded\_home} and \textit{shots\_conceded\_away}: a sum of shots, conceded in past $k$ games for home 
    and away team,
    \item \textit{corners\_difference\_home} and \textit{corners\_difference\_away}: a sum of corner differences for home and away 
    team, it the past $k$ games. Note, that corner difference is calculated by subtracting opponent corners from team corners. 
\end{itemize}

Columns \textit{index} and \textit{odds} are in the data frame just for analysis purposes. They were not used in building models.
All the other columns contain data, that was already available, before the game was played (for exception of column \texit{result}). Therefore, we can use that data to construct our model for predicting game results.

Note, that time consumption to build Bayesian networks with
\texttt{pomegranate} package grows exponentially with number of 
variables. That is why we could not use all the variables to build the network
in the experiment,
so we had to pick the most important ones. As it turned out, most 
features used could be bounded to 7. We decided to use the 
result, points collected, shots given and shots conceded statistics
for both teams. Other machin learning algorithms used all the columns (except 
for odds).

\subsection{Machine learning algorithms used}

The purpose of building our model, was firstly, to predict the game result as well as possible, but also secondly also to see if our
prediction can profit in the betting market. For example, if our algorithm predicts a home win to be the most probable final 
result and the bookmaker also offers lowest odds on home win, we could not tell for sure if our prediction would be sufficient to
profit. That is why we need our algorithms to return \textit{probabilities} for each game result. That way we can see, which result is profitable to bet on.

For that purpose, we only used \textbf{probabilistic classifiers}: Bayesian network, Naive Bayes classifier, Probabilistic neural 
network and Probabilistic $k$ nearest neighbours algorithm (for different $k$). All of this methods return probabilities for each
class (home win, away win or draw).

\subsection{Metrics for evaluation}

In order to evaluate our predictions for different models, we will use standard metrics for evaluating probabilistic classifiers. 

The most important metric will be \textbf{Brier score}, which is defined as 
$$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{R} {(P(f_{ti}) - o_{ti})},$$ in which $R$ is the number of possible classes of an event and $N$ the overall number of instances (size of our experiment). $f_{ti}$ is the predicted probability for class $t$ to 
happen in instance $i$. $o_{ti}$ is 1 if $i$-th event is of class $t$ and 0 otherwise. Better models have smaller Brier score.

We will not be calculating the \textbf{logloss} metric, because our data is far too large for personal computer's numerical 
precision.

From here on, we will assume, that our model predicted the outcome, whose prediction percentage will be the highest. 

Second metrics will be \textbf{precision} for each class. This is simply a percentage of correct predictions. The most important
will be the recall for \textit{home win}, as this class should have overall the highest probability of occurrence.

We will also calculate \textbf{recall} for every class. The most important will again be the recall for \textit{home win}, as 
this class should have overall the highest probability of occurrence. For example, a draw is harder to predict and usually 
most unlikely to happen. That is why we will have a lot of false negatives there.

To merge both precision and recall, we will also calculated the harmonic mean \textbf{F1 score}.

Next metric, that we will be using, will be \textbf{confusion matrix}. While this is not exactly a \textit{metric}, it will 
still provide with rich insight in our model's capability to predict a correct most probable result.

Last metric that we will be using will be \textbf{betting 
profitability}. We will compare returned probabilities with betting 
odds. We will assume to bet if we find a profitable combination and 
not to bet, if we do not. Then we will calculate our total profit for
each model. Better models will have bigger profit (smaller loss).

% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}

This paper was written as an attempt to investigate the area of sports predicting.
Sports predicting is mainly used by bookmakers, in order to offer bets, that do 
not produce loss of profit. But on the other hand, odds should be as fair (high) as possible
in order to attract more and more gamblers. So predicting the result of a game as accurately
as possible is the essence of every bookmaker. This article (and experiment) will focus on 
predicting the result of football matches in term of home win (home team scores more goals),
draw (same goal amount for each team) and away win (away team scores more goals).

First chapter of this paper contains information of related work. This includes a short recap
of new discoveries regarding Bayesian networks (that will be later used in an experiment), 
other machine learning techniques, that we use to predict sport results and also a summary of 
new discoveries in regard to betting on sports events.

Second chapter will write about the experiment we conducted. We will describe how we acquired 
data for our experiment, how the data was processed in order to be suitable for some machine 
learning techniques. We will also describe, which machine learning techniques we used in our experiment.
Then, we will talk about output data, that the algorithms will return and how to compare
results with each other. We will also discuss, which metrics for evaluation will be useful,
and which metrics actually matter the most for our experiment (and in general, which metrics
matter the most to bookmakers).

Third chapter of this paper will focus on results of our experiment. There we will compare 
different algorithms, that were applied to our data and evaluate each in regard to metrics.
We will also discuss, how data size affects quality of our prediction. We will compare 
returned probabilities for different match results, to probabilities, that were given by
bookmaker. Finally, we will decide, whether our models are able to beat the odds.

Fourth and final chapter is called \emph{Conclusion}, where all important results will be 
discussed. We will also evaluate our whole experiment and talk about the possible further work 
there.

\section{Related Work}

Unsurprisingly, a lot of work has already been done in this area, as sports betting is a field,
where enormous amount of money is being made every day. First, we will talk about Bayesian networks.

\subsection{Bayesian networks}

Bayesian networks are a type of probabilistic graphical model, that uses Bayesian 
inference for probability computations. Bayesian networks aim to model conditional 
dependence, and therefore causation, by representing conditional dependence by 
edges in a directed graph. Edges in graph correspond to conditional dependency and 
each node corresponds to a different random variable.

Our goal in this article will be, to predict correct type of result for a game, similar 
to the work done in article \cite{Razali_2017}. However, there will be many 
differences in experiment, which will be pointed out during the article.

\subsection{Sports predicting}

Betting in sports started with horse racing in the early 1900s. Although betting was 
not always legal (depends on a specific country), that did not stop people to still
gamble on sports events. That's why correctly predicting probabilities of sports 
results were very important to bookmakers, ever since betting existed. That is why
machine learning was a very interesting option for bookmakers to consider, as it 
was very objective and it used math and algorithms to predict results. Bookmakers 
could now offer also odds for games and competitions, that they were not so very familiar 
with.

First attempt to predict sports results with the help of machine learning was in
1977, where the author of article \cite{Stefani_1977} used a technique called least squared model.
This model was used to predict strength of opposing teams with goal scoring distribution matrix.
Observed accuracy in that model was 72 percent for college football games, 68 percent for pro 
football games and 69 percent for college basketball games.

First recorded usage of Bayesian networks in attempt to predict football results was used in
year 2001, in article \cite{Rue_2001}. The authors took an applied statistician's approach to the problem, 
suggesting a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model to estimate the time-dependent 
skills of all teams in a league, and to predict the next week-end's soccer matches.

Paper \cite{Joseph_2006} compared expert constructed Bayesian networks' ability to predict football 
results with other machine learning algorithms, such as decision tree learner, MC4, Naive Bayes learner,
Data driven Bayesian nets (which we will be using in our experiment), $K$-nearest neighbours, etc. 
The results from there confirmed, that Bayesian nets have great potential for predicting sport
results, as the authors had predictive accuracy of almost 60 percent, compared to second best
algorithm, $K$-nearest neighbours, which had an accuracy of little above 50 percent. Data, that the authors 
used for prediction, were home advantage, opposition team quality and characteristics of team's best players.


In 2010, article \cite{Baio_2010} proposed Bayesian hierarchical model, to predict final result 
of the game.

\subsection{Betting in sports}

Betting on sports events is almost as old as sport events itself. Bookmakers usually offer odds on 
some event. Odds tell bettors how much money they will receive, if that event happens. Odds are therefore 
directly related to the probability of the event. If probability of an event is higher, the odds for it will
naturally be lower. Bookmakers also never offer totally fair odds. That way they assure themselves of a sure
profit. For example, if a probability of an event is expected to be 50\%, bookmakers will never offer to pay 
out double of what you bet, but a little less. For example, bet365 (betting website from which we will get our
data), offers to pay out 1.90 times your bet, for an event with probability of 50\%. 

Profiting from a betting market has also been extensively studied in the past. People sometimes compare odds from
different bookmakers, to find an arbitrage strategy. Profiting from an inefficient association football gambling
market has been studied in article \cite{Constantinou_2013} from 2013. In the paper, a Bayesian network is used
for forecasting match outcomes. Profitability, risk and uncertainty are evaluated in there. Although the author
presented a model, that is less complex then some previous ones, it returned better results. The model considers
both objective and subjective information for prediction.  However, it is important to point out, that the model,
which generated profit, was highly critically dependent on the knowledge of the expert. Performance, generated 
only on past data, would not be as successful.

\section{Experiment description}

This chapter contains all the description of how the experiment was carried out.

\subsection{Tools used}

The data tables were acquired from the web page \emph{Football-Data.co.uk}, and was in the \texttt{.csv} form.
Then data was processed with a programming language \texttt{Python} and its library \texttt{pandas}. Then we
applied different machine learning algorithms from \texttt{sklearn} package. Returned data was further processed 
with \texttt{pandas}. All the plots, displayed in this paper, were made with \texttt{matplotlib} library.

\subsection{Data}

As previously stated, all data of football games, was acquired from \emph{Football-Data.co.uk}. Data describes every
football game of Spanish first division, LaLiga (Primera División), from season 2013/2014 to 2021/2022. Since each season has 
380 games, total data set contained 3420 games. Every game was a row in the data and for each game, the columns represented 
the stats from the game. Some data was unnecessary for match result prediction, for example number of yellow cards from each game.
Important statistics, that was later used in model construction, was:
\begin{itemize}
    \item date of the game,
    \item home team name,
    \item away team name,
    \item home team number of scored goals,
    \item away team number of scored goals,
    \item result of the game (home win, away win or draw),
    \item home team number of shots,
    \item away team number of shots,
    \item home team number of corners,
    \item away team number of corners,
    \item bet365 odds for home win,
    \item bet365 odds for away win,
    \item bet365 odds for draw
\end{itemize}

It is important to point out, that data in this form cannot be used to predict results. The data was aquired during the game,
but our prediction must be made before the game. It would of course be pointless to predict the result of the game, if we had 
already known, how much goals any of the teams had scored. So we needed to find a way, to predict a result of the game, without using that game's data. We did that by using data from games, that happened before the match, that we are predicting. 
That procedure is described in \emph{Data processing} subsection.

Data of odds will be used to compare our algorithm's predicted probabilities with bookmaker's predicted probabilities.

\subsection{Data processing}

In order to transform the data, so we could construct models for predicting, we firstly dropped columns, that were not needed
in data. Then each game was assigned a unique index. An iteration through data frame was performed, in order to obtain each team's
order of playing. A new dictionary was defined, where team names were keys and values were ordered lists of game indexes. 

Then another iteration was made through the original data frame. For each played game, we looked for $k$ (we tried different $k$-s
and also compared results) previous games for home and away team. The general idea behind this was, that we determined strength of
a team, based on its previous results. For example, points, that the team received in previous $k$ games were calculated, goals, that the home or away team scored were summed, etc.

In the end, we got a new data frame, with the following columns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{index}: unique index, assigned to each game;
    \item \textit{result}: final result of the game (home win, draw or away win),
    \item \textit{odds\_home}, \textit{odds\_draw} and \textit{odds\_away}: bet365 odds for each possible outcome of the game;
    \item \textit{points\_home} and \textit{points\_away}: points, that home and away team scored in the last $k$ games. Note,
    that a team gets 3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss;
    \item \textit{goals\_scored\_home} and \textit{goals\_scored\_away}: a sum of goals, scored in past $k$ games for home and away
    team;
    \item \textit{goals\_conceded\_home} and \textit{goals\_conceded\_away}: a sum of goals, conceded in past $k$ games for home 
    and away team;
    \item \textit{shots\_given\_home} and \textit{shots\_given\_away}: a sum of shots given, in past $k$ games for home 
    and away team,
    \item \textit{shots\_conceded\_home} and \textit{shots\_conceded\_away}: a sum of shots, conceded in past $k$ games for home 
    and away team,
    \item \textit{corners\_difference\_home} and \textit{corners\_difference\_away}: a sum of corner differences for home and away 
    team, it the past $k$ games. Note, that corner difference is calculated by subtracting opponent corners from team corners. 
\end{itemize}

Columns \textit{index} and \textit{odds} are in the data frame just for analysis purposes. They were not used in building models.
All the other columns contain data, that was already available, before the game was played (for exception of column \texit{result}). Therefore, we can use that data to construct our model for predicting game results.

\subsection{Machine learning algorithms used}

The purpose of building our model, was firstly, to predict the game result as well as possible, but also secondly, to see if our
prediction can profit in the betting market. For example, if our algorithm predicts a home win to be the most probable final 
result and the bookmaker also offers lowest odds on home win, we cannot tell for sure, if our prediction would be sufficient to
profit. That is why we need our algorithms to return \textit{probabilities} for each game result. That way we can see, on which
result it is profitable to bet.

For that purpose, we only used \textbf{probabilistic classifiers}: Bayesian network, Naive Bayes classifier, Probabilistic neural 
network and Probabilistic $k$ nearest neighbours algorithm (for different $k$). All of this methods return probabilities for each
class (home win, away win or draw).

\subsection{Metrics for evaluation}

In order to evaluate our predictions for different model, we will use standard metrics for evaluating probabilistic classifiers. 
The most important metric will be \textbf{Brier score}, which is defined as 
$$\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{t=1}^{R} {(P(f_{ti}) - o_{ti})},$$ in which $R$ is the number of possible classes in which the
event can fall, and $N$ the overall number of instances of all classes. $f_{ti}$ is the predicted probability for class $t$ to 
happen in instance $i$. $o_{ti}$ is 1 if $i$-th event is of class $t$ and 0 otherwise. Better models have smaller Brier score.

We will not be calculating the \textbf{logloss} metric, because our data is far too large for personal computer's numerical 
precision.

From here on, we will assume, that our model predicted the outcome, whose prediction percentage will be the highest. 

Second metrics will be \textbf{precision} for each class. This is simply a percentage of correct predictions. The most important
will be the recall for \textit{home win}, as this class should have overall the highest probability of occurrence.

We will also calculate \textbf{recall} for every class. The most important will again be the recall for \textit{home win}, as 
this class should have overall the highest probability of occurrence. For example, a draw is harder to predict and usually 
most unlikely to happen. That is why we will have a lot of false negatives there.

To merge both precision and recall, we will also calculated the harmonic mean \textbf{F1 score}.

Last metric, that we will be using, will be \textbf{confusion matrix}. While this is not exactly a \textit{metric}, it will 
still provide with rich insight in our model's capability to predict a correct most probable result.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

%\begin{figure}[!t]
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{myfigure}
% where an .eps filename suffix will be assumed under latex, 
% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command,
% and the \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil is used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a 
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centering
%\subfloat[Case I]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{box}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}
%\caption{Simulation results.}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals/conferences use top floats
% exclusively. Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat
% command of the stfloats package.

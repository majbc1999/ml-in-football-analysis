abstract = {The issues of modeling asscoiation football prediction model has become increasingly popular in the last few years and many different approaches of prediction models have been proposed with the point of evaluating the attributes that lead a football team to lose, draw or win the match. There are three types of approaches has been considered for predicting football matches results which include statistical approaches, machine learning approaches and Bayesian approaches. Lately, many studies regarding football prediction models has been produced using Bayesian approaches. This paper proposes a Bayesian Networks (BNs) to predict the results of football matches in term of home win (H), away win (A) and draw (D). The English Premier League (EPL) for three seasons of 2010-2011, 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 has been selected and reviewed. K-fold cross validation has been used for testing the accuracy of prediction model. The required information about the football data is sourced from a legitimate site at http://www.football-data.co.uk. BNs achieved predictive accuracy of 75.09% in average across three seasons. It is hoped that the results could be used as the benchmark output for future research in predicting football matches results.}

abstract = {A common discussion subject for the male part of the population in particular is the prediction of the next week-end's soccer matches, especially for the local team. Knowledge of offensive and defensive skills is valuable in the decision process before making a bet at a bookmaker. We take an applied statistician's approach to the problem, suggesting a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model to estimate the time-dependent skills of all teams in a league, and to predict the next week-end's soccer matches. The problem is more intricate than it may appear at first glance, as we need to estimate the skills of all teams simultaneously as they are dependent. It is now possible to deal with such inference problems by using the Markov chain Monte Carlo iterative simulation technique. We show various applications of the proposed model based on the English Premier League and division 1 in 1997–1998: prediction with application to betting, retrospective analysis of the final ranking, the detection of surprising matches and how each team's properties vary during the season.},

abstract = {Bayesian networks (BNs) provide a means for representing, displaying, and making available in a usable form the knowledge of experts in a given field. In this paper, we look at the performance of an expert constructed BN compared with other machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting the outcome (win, lose, or draw) of matches played by Tottenham Hotspur Football Club. The period under study was 1995–1997 – the expert BN was constructed at the start of that period, based almost exclusively on subjective judgement. Our objective was to determine retrospectively the comparative accuracy of the expert BN compared to some alternative ML models that were built using data from the two-year period. The additional ML techniques considered were: MC4, a decision tree learner; Naive Bayesian learner; Data Driven Bayesian (a BN whose structure and node probability tables are learnt entirely from data); and a K-nearest neighbour learner. The results show that the expert BN is generally superior to the other techniques for this domain in predictive accuracy. The results are even more impressive for BNs given that, in a number of key respects, the study assumptions place them at a disadvantage. For example, we have assumed that the BN prediction is ‘incorrect’ if a BN predicts more than one outcome as equally most likely (whereas, in fact, such a prediction would prove valuable to somebody who could place an ‘each way’ bet on the outcome). Although the expert BN has now long been irrelevant (since it contains variables relating to key players who have retired or left the club) the results here tend to confirm the excellent potential of BNs when they are built by a reliable domain expert. The ability to provide accurate predictions without requiring much learning data are an obvious bonus in any domain where data are scarce. Moreover, the BN was relatively simple for the expert to build and its structure could be used again in this and similar types of problems.}

abstract = {We present a Bayesian network (BN) model for forecasting Association Football match outcomes. Both objective and subjective information are considered for prediction, and we demonstrate how probabilities transform at each level of model component, whereby predictive distributions follow hierarchical levels of Bayesian inference. The model was used to generate forecasts for each match of the 2011/2012 English Premier League (EPL) season, and forecasts were published online prior to the start of each match. Profitability, risk and uncertainty are evaluated by considering various unit-based betting procedures against published market odds. Compared to a previously published successful BN model, the model presented in this paper is less complex and is able to generate even more profitable returns.}

# Machine learning in football predicting and betting

Analysis of machine learning methods and some simulations for sport predicting. This is the project for course Machine Learning in year 2022. Project is divinded into various subparts, described below.

## Data retrieval and processing 

Directory `/data/` contains data retrieving scripts and retrieved data for sports events. Also contains scripts for data processing (preparing data for different models).

## Machine learning

All machine learning algortihms and methods are in `/simulation/` folder. Steps for simulation:
- data separation to test and learning data
- learn as much models as possible for predicting final result
- return predictions

## Data analysis

Returned predictions and data analysis scripts with plots and other visualisations are in `/analysis/` folder.

## Report writing

Everything regarding the final report is in the `/report/` directory.
